# Welcome to RecPy!
This Git repository is an attempt to share python code for use in Recreation research for uses such as:

*   ArcPy for editing, appending, and batch processing shapefiles.
*   Producing figures for TRAFx and "Norm Curve/PCI".
*   Data wrangling of TRAFx data outside of TRAFx's Datanet
